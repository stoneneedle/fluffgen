# FluffGen

## Overview
Fluffgen is a system-agnostic fluff generator (fluff being things like appearance/personality, as opposed to crunch, the actual rules/math) for D&D. It can generate NPCs, spells, monsters, etc. for Dungeon Masters (DMs) looking to get a lot of content in a hurry.

## User Stories
As a DM, I want to generate content for my D&D session, so that I can reduce the amount of prep time and increase the breadth of worlds being created.

As a developer, I want to develop procedural content generation systems, so that I can ultimately weave it into one giant world generator to virtually eliminate DM prep time.
